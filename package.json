Design a magical landing page for 'Mover' where users describe what they want their devices to do in plain English, and see it happen - no code visible. Core concept:

Hero Statement:
"Tell it. Watch it work."
Visual flow:
• User types "Make my lights blink when someone approaches"
• Virtual device (LED + motion sensor) immediately demonstrates this behavior
Key Features (Without Jargon):
• Turn everyday language into device actions instantly
• Fix mistakes through conversation ("Make it faster")
• Test ideas on realistic virtual hardware
• Share working projects with one link
Visual Requirements:
Clean, app-like interface hiding all technical elements
Color theme: Warm orange (action) + trust blue
Show:
• Text input box: "Describe your device's behavior..."
• Live device simulator reacting to commands
• Example gallery:
"Notify me when mail arrives" → mailbox sensor demo
"Water plants every morning" → self-watering garden
For:
• Teachers making tech accessible
• Makers who think in results, not code
• Beginners intimidated by programming
Tone: "You imagine, we handle the magic"
CTAs: "Describe Your Idea" + "See It Work Free"
Include: Mobile demo video showing 30-second creation cycle"
